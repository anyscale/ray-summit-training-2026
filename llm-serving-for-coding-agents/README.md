# llm-serving-for-coding-agents

Self-host an open-source coding-assistant LLM on **Anyscale + Ray Serve LLM** and use it from
**Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor**.

This repo serves `qwen3.6-27b`, a 27B FP8 hybrid-reasoning and tool-calling model that
[Qwen positions as comparable to Claude Opus 4.5](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3.6-27b). With
**direct streaming** enabled, one Anyscale service exposes the native APIs expected by all three agents,
without running a separate proxy.

## API Endpoints (via Direct Streaming)

Direct streaming lets one Ray Serve LLM deployment expose the OpenAI and Anthropic Messages APIs
without a separate proxy. Enable it with service-level environment variables (see
[`part1-deploy-naive/service_naive.yaml`](./part1-deploy-naive/service_naive.yaml)):

```yaml
env_vars:
  RAY_SERVE_ENABLE_HA_PROXY: "1"
  RAY_SERVE_LLM_ENABLE_DIRECT_STREAMING: "1"
```

Set these at the **service level**, not in a per-deployment `runtime_env`, so the Ray Serve controller sees
them during startup. See the [Part 1 README](./part1-deploy-naive/README.md) for details.

With direct streaming enabled, the deployment exposes each agent's expected API path:

| Path | Used by |
|---|---|
| `POST /v1/messages` | Claude Code |
| `POST /v1/responses` | Codex |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | Cursor |

## Prerequisites

- An Anyscale account and the Anyscale CLI (`pip install anyscale`, then `anyscale login`).
- Claude Code, Codex, and/or Cursor.
- The stock **public** image `anyscale/ray-llm:2.57.0-py312-cu130` (ray-llm 2.57.0 + **vLLM 0.25.1**),
  pullable from Docker Hub with no creds — Part 1 uses it as-is, since 0.25.1 accepts Claude Code's
  `/v1/messages` schema natively. Part 3 builds on the same base to add the RunAI Streamer.

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy the model

From a terminal in an **Anyscale workspace** (running the image above):

```bash
cd part1-deploy-naive
serve run serve_qwen3_6_27b_naive:app     # serves at http://localhost:8000
```

Or deploy as a public Anyscale **Service** (needed for Cursor, and for sharing):
`anyscale service deploy -f service_naive.yaml`, then grab the URL + token from the console
(**Services → your service → Query**).

### 2. Connect a coding agent

Point Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor at the served model via
[**part2-connect-clients-production**](./part2-connect-clients-production/README.md) — all three connect to the public service URL + token.

### 3. (Optional) Deploy the optimized service

The Part 1 deployment uses 4× L4 GPUs (`g6.12xlarge`, TP=4). Part 3 moves to a single
**RTX PRO 6000 96 GB** (`g7e.4xlarge`) with TP=1, FP8 KV cache, full 256K context, MTP speculative
decoding, and autoscale 1→4:

```bash
cd ../part3-optimize
anyscale service deploy -f service-always-on.yaml --working-dir .
```

Measured performance gains and options include:

- **MTP speculative decoding** — default for coding-agent traffic; improves decode **1.89×**, from 45.6 tok/s to 86.4 tok/s.
- **RunAI Streamer** — optional cold-start path; reduces cold weight-load time **3.4×**, from ~85 s to ~25 s, but cannot be combined with MTP ([vllm#42060](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/42060), still open).
- **Torch.compile cache** — reduces compile startup time **8.5×**, from 74.5 s to 8.8 s, on the no-MTP path only. (Re-measured at 8.0×, 48.5 s → 6.0 s, on vLLM 0.25.1 — absolute timings shift with the vLLM version.)
- **FP8 KV cache** — doubles 256K-context KV concurrency, from ~3.27× to 6.53×.
- **CUDA graphs** — improves decode throughput **2.87×**, from 15.9 tok/s to 45.6 tok/s.
- **Autoscale** — grows serving capacity from 1 to 4 replicas with round-robin routing.

Deployment options include:

- **Always-on config** — [`part3-optimize/service-always-on.yaml`](./part3-optimize/service-always-on.yaml)
  keeps one warm replica online for min-replica-1 service behavior.
- **Work-hours config** — [`part3-optimize/service-work-hours.yaml`](./part3-optimize/service-work-hours.yaml)
  uses min replicas 0 plus [`warmup.sh`](./part3-optimize/warmup.sh) to target
  work-hours-only GPU spend; verify the `g7e` node actually terminates after idle before relying on
  the savings.

Then point your agent at the new service URL (Part 2). See the [`Part 3 README`](./part3-optimize/README.md)
for toggle defaults and the work-hours caveat, [`BENCHMARKS.md`](./part3-optimize/notes/BENCHMARKS.md) for
measured numbers, and [`INCOMPATIBILITIES.md`](./part3-optimize/notes/INCOMPATIBILITIES.md) for knobs that
can't be combined.

### 4. (Optional) Combine with Claude Opus via a LiteLLM gateway

Parts 1–3 send all traffic to the self-hosted model. Part 4 deploys a **LiteLLM gateway** as a second,
CPU-only Anyscale Service in front of it, so Claude Code defaults to your Anyscale model but
**automatically falls back to Claude Opus** on errors — billed to each user's own Claude Max/Pro
subscription via OAuth passthrough — and users can switch models on the fly with `/model` or let a
complexity-based `smart-router` decide per request:

```bash
cd ../part4-litellm-router/gateway
anyscale service deploy -f service.yaml
```

See the [`Part 4 README`](./part4-litellm-router/README.md) for setup and
[`ROUTING.md`](./part4-litellm-router/ROUTING.md) for how the smart router decides.

### 5. (Optional) Roll out to the whole team via managed settings

Part 4 still asks every developer to run a launcher script. Part 5 removes that last step: an admin
pushes two JSON files ([`managed-settings.json`](./part5-enterprise-rollout/managed-settings.json),
[`managed-mcp.json`](./part5-enterprise-rollout/managed-mcp.json)) to each machine via MDM /
config management, and plain `claude` routes through the gateway with **zero per-user setup** —
while each user's Claude subscription login stays intact for the Opus fallback. The guide also
includes a **no-admin validation path** (curl, project-scope settings, and a rootful Linux
container) so you can prove the whole mechanism before involving IT.

See the [`Part 5 README`](./part5-enterprise-rollout/README.md).

## Collecting Real Claude Code Session Data for Benchmarking

The Part 3 numbers in [`BENCHMARKS.md`](./part3-optimize/notes/BENCHMARKS.md) were measured by replaying
real Claude Code sessions rather than synthetic prompts. Claude Code saves every session locally as JSONL
(one JSON object per line) at:

```
~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session-id>.jsonl
```

where `<project>` is your working-directory path with non-alphanumeric characters replaced by `-` — a
project at `/Users/alice/code/myapp` becomes `-Users-alice-code-myapp`.

Copy the sessions you want to benchmark with, then ask your coding agent to extract the per-request token
counts and replay them against the service. Transcripts contain your source code and prompts, so treat
trace files like source code.

## How Much Does It Save?

The simple planning number is **~50 registered developers per RTX PRO 6000 GPU**. The GPU can hold
roughly **24 average-length active cached sessions** at once, and the lower planning number leaves
room for long prompts, work-hour spikes, and several developers asking the model to work at the same
time.

On that sizing, always-on self-hosting is about **$58 per developer-month**:

- **Self-hosted:** about **$2,900/month per GPU**, or **$58/dev-month** at 50 developers/GPU.
- **Subscription seats:** about **$200/dev-month** for Max-20x/Ultra-class plans.
- **Token-metered usage:** about **$800/dev-month** for heavy API or enterprise-tier usage; Pylon
  measured about **$780/dev-month**.

For a 100-developer team, plan on **2+ GPUs during busy periods**. The always-on base case is about
**$5.8K/month**, compared with **$20K/month** for seats or **$80K/month** for token-metered billing.
That works out to roughly **$14.2K/month saved vs seats** and **$74.2K/month saved vs token billing**.

Work-hours mode can be cheaper if the GPU nodes really shut down outside the workday. In that case,
the target is about **$840/month per GPU**, or **$17/dev-month** at 50 developers/GPU. For the same
100-developer planning case, that is about **$18.3K/month saved vs seats** and **$78.3K/month saved
vs token billing**.

The break-even point is small because the GPU is a shared fixed cost: about **15 developers** versus
subscription seats for always-on, about **4 developers** versus seats for work-hours, and **1–4
developers** versus token-metered billing.

These savings only matter if the model is good enough for the same coding-agent work. The quality
case is that [Qwen's launch post compares Qwen3.6-27B with Claude Opus 4.5](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3.6-27b),
but teams should still validate it on their own repos and workflows. See
[`part3-optimize/notes/COST-ESTIMATE.md`](./part3-optimize/notes/COST-ESTIMATE.md) for the full
savings tables, token math, and caveats.
