# serve_qwen3_6_27b_naive.py
#
# NAIVE baseline — the "before" in this tutorial. Deploy this only to feel the difference
# vs. the optimized Part 3 version; don't run it in production.
#
# ── What makes it naive ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# GPU choice: 4× L4 (g6.12xlarge), tensor_parallel_size=4
#   All 4 L4s sit on one node, connected via PCIe (no NVLink). L4 has the lowest memory
#   bandwidth of serving GPUs (~300 GB/s), and the PCIe interconnect adds communication
#   overhead between the GPUs. It's a common, widely-available shape — which is exactly why
#   it makes a realistic "before". (The FP8 weights actually fit on a single bigger GPU —
#   see Part 3, which moves to 1× RTX PRO 6000 96GB at TP=1.)
#
# It's highly UN-optimized on purpose: default engine settings, single replica, no autoscaling.
# All the tuning lives in Part 3 (see ../part3-optimize/); Part 1 is just the baseline.
#
# ── One thing it DOES enable: direct streaming ──────────────────────────────────────
#
# Direct streaming is an API feature (not a performance tweak) that puts vLLM's native
# app behind HAProxy so this single endpoint serves all three agent protocols:
#
#   /v1/chat/completions  (Cursor)
#   /v1/messages          (Claude Code)
#   /v1/responses         (Codex)
#
# This is what lets Part 2 connect all three agents with no proxy and no LiteLLM.
#
# It's enabled by two CLUSTER-LEVEL env vars. In a workspace, set them as workspace
# environment variables; in a Service, put them in service_naive.yaml (top-level env_vars):
#
#   RAY_SERVE_ENABLE_HA_PROXY=1
#   RAY_SERVE_LLM_ENABLE_DIRECT_STREAMING=1
#
# IMPORTANT: these must be cluster-level, NOT per-deployment runtime_env or
# in-module os.environ. The Ray Serve controller reads RAY_SERVE_ENABLE_HA_PROXY at
# startup (ray/serve/_private/build_app.py); a runtime_env only reaches the replicas,
# so the app fails with "ingress_request_router requires HAProxy." Anyscale applies
# cluster-level env vars across the cluster, so the controller inherits them.
#
# Safe here because there's no custom request router. (Direct streaming used to conflict with
# the stock PrefixCacheAffinityRouter; ray#64328 fixed that in ray-llm 2.57. Either way, the
# single-replica default RoundRobinRouter used here is fine.)
